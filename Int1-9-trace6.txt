~~ Cycle Detection by removing states ~~

Step 0:
  Elimination of entry points: 0 
  Remaining Vertices: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 
  New entry points: 4 5 6 7 10 

Step 1:
  Elimination of entry points: 4 5 6 7 10 
  Remaining Vertices: 1 2 3 8 9 11 
  New entry points: 1 8 3 2 

Step 2:
  Elimination of entry points: 1 8 3 2 
  Remaining Vertices: 9 11 
  New entry points: 9 

Step 3:
  Elimination of entry points: 9 
  Remaining Vertices: 11 
  New entry points: 11 

Step 4:
  Elimination of entry points: 11 
  Remaining Vertices: None
