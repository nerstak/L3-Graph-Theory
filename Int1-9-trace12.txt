~~ Cycle Detection by removing states ~~

Step 0:
  Elimination of entry points: 0 
  Remaining Vertices: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 
  New entry points: 4 6 7 

Step 1:
  Elimination of entry points: 4 6 7 
  Remaining Vertices: 1 2 3 5 8 9 10 11 
  New entry points: 5 3 10 2 

Step 2:
  Elimination of entry points: 5 3 10 2 
  Remaining Vertices: 1 8 9 11 
  New entry points: 8 1 

Step 3:
  Elimination of entry points: 8 1 
  Remaining Vertices: 9 11 
  New entry points: 9 

Step 4:
  Elimination of entry points: 9 
  Remaining Vertices: 11 
  New entry points: 11 

Step 5:
  Elimination of entry points: 11 
  Remaining Vertices: None
  New entry points: None

The graph does not contains a cycle.
